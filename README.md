# UnitOfTime's gophermark

This repo contains code for UnitOfTime's gophermark, written in multiple languages. The goal is to compare multiple languages' rendering performance.

## Running the gophermark

### C++ + OpenGL

TODO (instructions) (see https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL)

### Go + OpenGL

```bash
cd go+opengl/regular
sh test.sh # Run the test
ruby convert.rb # Convert to excel file
```

### Swift + Metal

TODO (not finished)

## Contributing

Feel free to open a pull request, adding your favorite language to the repo.

### Naming conventions

If you add a new language, add a new folder calld {your_language_name}+{graphics_library} in lowercase.

Then, add instructions for running it to the readme (in alphabetical order, so the order in which the foldrs appear on GitHub).
